### IIT Madras grad of 2005; Techie & (serial) Entrepreneur since then

I build things.

Having founded 3 startups where I built the complete tech from scratch, figured user acquisition channels, maintained the products & provided support. I am a generalist so far. Looking to take a break from generalist profile & being a specialist for a change. Prefer working for a company that appreciate generalists & believe in product first approach.

## Work Experience 

> I like solving problems I have insight into

### Commu-SQS
**Side project - July 2015**

An Amazon SQS based server to Android client communication free from GCM delay. Server writes to queue, Android client reads from the queue in a background service. On the app/service being shutdown due to user force close, a server daemon monitors the queue status & send wake up GCM for client to start listening on the queue again. 

**Product Skills:** Instead of adding to the server & Android app code, created a separate service that can run independently. The idea is to create the app code into a library which the main app could use. 

**Tech Skills:** Wrote the app & server code. **Technologies:** Android, Ruby on Rails.

### Griggi
**Side project - April 2015 to Present**

Griggi is **Uber for Wifi** . Its a shared WiFi ecosytem aimed at letting people share their home WiFi connection with needy people around. 

**Product Skills:** Productize a personal problem of no broadband whenever I travel to hometown. Site is supply centric as figured that demand will not be a problem if enough supply into the system. Figured business use-cases like Griggi can be offered as free WiFi solution to cafes/restaurants/co-working-spaces. Validated its a tough B2C sell through a site that makes people believe the idea is live & then gauging people interest through user clicks on action items. Successfully got the idea on [top of Hacker News]() to get good number of site visits to be able to validate the idea. 

**Tech Skills:** Built the website with screenshots in a week from an existing theme. **Technologies:** HTML/CSS (Bootstrap)

### AnOpenLettr
**Side project - Feb to March 2015**

AnOpenLettr intend to be a better Mouthshut by letting people create their rants with verifable data like email screenshots etc.

**Product Skills:** Insights - brands respond better on open channels like Twitter to rants, Twitter does not have enough space to write about rant in details, combining the two as the product. Quickly validated by putting out some of the personal rant (& helping a friend with it). The long term vision is to be a better Mouthshut/Akosha by focussing on consumer problem resolution. 

**Tech Skills:** Put the site as Jekyll blog on github to avoid any server costs. **Technologies:** Jekyll, Git, Github pages.

### Pillion
**Side project - Oct 2014 to Jan 2015**

Pillion started as yet-another-ride-sharing app but evolved into a whatsapp-group-for-ride-sharing. 

**Product Skills:** Insight - during peak hours, there is dearth of cabs but enough office goer vehicles on the road, so why not hitch a ride. Again, if enough supply could be created, demand will come. Created a mobile app from scratch which got ok response at Techhub demo day. Figured, ride-sharing is a sparse network problem. Decided to create an app to help existing car-poolers to communicate better. Generalized it to have private & public pool. People going from point A-B can join the room & talk to each other for their ride sharing needs.  

**Tech Skills:** Took source code of an existing app from a friend & created Pillion Android app out of it. Picked Android to build the app. Created server side APIs too. **Technologies:** Android, Ruby on Rails.

### Expensio
**Side project - July 2014 to Aug 2014**

Android app for better expense sharing with friends

**Product Skills:** I had come back to this idea multiple times before. Had used the expense sharing app [Splitwise] but found it had features lacking from the shared google spreadsheet solution we had been using. Decided to revamp the app, rather adding additional features for better user-flow. Also, figured that for sustainable app use, there should be a group chat feature built into it.

**Tech Skills:** Created just the Android front-end as a validation to show to friends & get feedback.
