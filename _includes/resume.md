### Software Engineer, Product Manager & High Tech (serial)Entrepreneur since 2005

I started my career as an algorithm engineer but realized (& eventually moved) to product startups. I had been dabbling with startups since 2008. I started working as a software engineer at Elina Networks, did online freelance for 6 months & then started with my first venture in 2010. After that I founded two more startups & the last startup got seed funding from Kima Ventures (their first investment in India).

I am motivated to solve one of my own problems through the startups that I founded. I was largely the tech guy involved in my startups but picked up other skills like online marketing ( SEO & social media management), hiring, handing company finances, a bit of web design (largely working with existing CSS frameworks & modifying it as per requirement) & mobile app development (just Android for now).

I had open sourced a few of the apps that I developed. That also mean that I am pretty well versed with version control software like git.
Apart from entrepreneurship, my passion lies in sports & music. I am a very cost conscious person & nearly all my efforts revolve around cutting costs or creating technology that would cut cost or helping people cut cost.

My key skills are:

* End to end product development including conceptualization, ideation, launching, validation, user acquisition, rinse & repeat.
* Metric/Data driven product evolution/feature discovery.
* Prioritize features & say No to features that look like low hanging fruits but limited value add.
* All-rounder / One man army / Can do it all that takes to take a software product off the ground.

Following technologies I have worked with (in decreasing order of expertise):

* Ruby on Rails
* Javascript/Jquery
* HTML / HTML 5
* Devops - Linux / shell scripting / server deploying & maintenance 
* CSS / CSS3 / Less
* Database - Mysql, Sqlite & a bit of Postgresql
* Git
* Mobile technologies like Android (Java), Ionic framework (picked up very basic AngularJS)
* Nodejs (built an open source web terminal)
* PHP
* Perl


## CoFounder: Codelearn.org
### May 2012 - July 2014

The idea was born as education wing of my previous startup StalkNinja where we wanted newbies to be able to become good enough developers to take/complete complex software projects on their own. The idea was to let serious (read strong hearted) users straight (& deep) dive into hands-on tutorials. 

I conceptualized & created **Codelearn Playground** from scratch. We were starting with Ruby on Rails tutorial & wanted to provide a platform to the users to be able to create apps right in the browser. The user was provided a secluded space on the server & he is able to work with it like a cloud IDE. *I was able to get the first version working in 2 months all by myself*.

Check what people said about Codelearn on the [Hacker News post](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4213260).

P.S. - the post stayed on the front page for around 9 hours, drove 6k visits & 300 signups & 300 people requesting invite.

Later, I got the Codelearn Playground terminal recoded using Nodejs. I largely played a product manager role guiding a remote intern to be able to achieve a reasonably low latency which was the most important aspect. [The terminal is open sourced on github](https://github.com/pocha/terminal-codelearn).

**I also handled support, design of website & company finance when my co-founder left in May 2013. Codelearn was funded by Kima Ventures at a million dollar valuation**.

## Founder: StalkNinja.com
### Dec 2010 - Nov 2012

Stalk Ninja is not an internship/job site. Its more on the lines of creating affordable freelance eco-system aiming to help startups by engaging students. Both students & startups earn review during their course of interaction. Its easy for startups to pick up an student based on his past performance in the system.

For students, it works like LinkedIn. You can show-case your profile & experience to companies that offer you internship/job.

## CoFounder: Minkle.in
### Dec 2009 - Dec 2010

* Created a mobile platform to enable last 'mobile' connectivity of various cloud based applications (typically web apps).
* Through a few clicks on a web interface, the app is now available to the target audience on their mobile through Minkle platform.
* To cater to indian conditions, the platform can talk over SMS & GPRS/1x-data connectivity isnt a must to use the platform & hence the web/cloud app. 
* Foraying into the B2C domain with custom build end-to-end utilities for mobile consumers. First in the kitty is air-ticket booking app powered by cleartrip.
